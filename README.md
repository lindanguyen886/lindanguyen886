## 🧩 My Approach to Data & AI

I prioritize:

- Understanding the business problem before building models  
- Choosing interpretable solutions when appropriate  
- Structuring projects for clarity and reproducibility  
- Designing AI systems with real-world decision logic  
- Communicating trade-offs clearly to non-technical stakeholders  

I believe strong analytics and AI should not only be technically sound — but also interpretable, reliable, and decision-oriented.
